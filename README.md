# ASUS G750JM BSI7N23
## OS X El Capitan 10.11.15  

### Not Working
 - Sleep causes sound to not work on wakeup
   - TODO: Fix this using RehabMan's CodecCommander and hda-verb
 - GTX860M is disabled in my DSDT to conserve on power.
 
### Working
Everything else. Please let me know if anything else is not working.

### Optical Drive
I've kept the Optical drive SSDT in this repo for those that need it. I've replaced it with a 3rd SSDT 
so I can't verify if it is working. Please let me know if it is not.

### Keyboard and Toucpad

My keyboard / touchpad settings are very opiniotaed. Please use the script in the misc folder to 
change them to your liking or find the original kexts from EMlyDinEsH and DSDT patches from Arise.

## Thanks

Thanks to tonymacx86 ,Arise, EMlyDinEsH, toleda, Arise, and Rehabman. Without their amazing work nothing 
this close to perfection would be possible.
